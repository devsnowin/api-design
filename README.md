# Api Design using express and prsima

An API is a Server. This may seem obvious, but really needs to be understood. A server is an app that has no visual representation and is always running. Usually connected to a network and shared among many clients (UIs, web apps, mobile apps, other servers, etc). Servers usually sit in front of a DB and facilitate access to that DB.

# ORM - Object relational mapper

It's an intermediator between the server and database. It interact with database in an object-oriented approach.

# Prisma

Prsima is a DB agnostic, type safe ORM.

# Migrations

- is to teach the database about the shape of the data or if you already have a schema and wants to have change to it, you can do migrations.
